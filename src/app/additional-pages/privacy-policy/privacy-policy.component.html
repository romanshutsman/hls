  </p>
  <h2>7. Information That We Obtain from Third Party Sources
  </h2>
  <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources (including social media service providers), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.
    The types of information we collect from third parties include information about your online interaction with such parties and we use this information to monitor and analyse trends and usage, improve the quality our service and tailor your experience and recommend products and services that we think you will be interested in.
  </p>
  <h2>8. Who We May Disclose Your Information To</h2>
  <p>We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
  </p>
  <p>1. to our Partners (as defined in Terms and Conditions) who provide services to you (for example, to identify your mobile number at the restaurant when you reserve a table and in order to give you a discount). The majority of our service providers operate within Europe, however sometimes they may send your personal information to the USA. An example of the service provider we use and why are set out below. If you want any more information, please do ask.
    Google assists us with our analytics and helps us to set advertisements that reflect your interests.
  </p>
  <p>2. to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</p>
  <p>3. to an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy; </p>
  <p>4. to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</p>
  <h2>9. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Visitors Only)
  </h2>
  <p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
    We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
    <br>
    If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). <br>
    Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
  </p>
  <h2>10. How We Keep Your Personal Information Secure
  </h2>
  <p>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
    The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take steps to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the site and/or mobile application.
  </p>
  <h2>11. Data Retention
  </h2>
  <p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. We will not keep personal information for longer than 2 years after your account was closed, and we will always endeavour to anonymise information 6 months after we receive it.
  </p>
  <h2>12. International Data Transfers
  </h2>
  <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
    However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These safeguards are either (a) having the model clauses appended to the contract we have with the third party; or (b) the third party is in a country that has adequate data protection laws.
  </p>
  <h2>13. Your Data Protection Rights
  </h2>
  <p>You have the following data protection rights:
    If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to Contact Us” heading above.<br> Please note, that if you request us to delete your data you must uninstall our mobile application (if you have been using this on your phone) to remove any residual data stored on your device.
    In addition, if you are a resident of the European Union, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to Contact Us” heading above.
    As a recommendation service, we think it is really important that we send you communications about our services and promotional offers that we think may interest you, as we would hate to think you missed out on a discount with one of Partners. However, you have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by contacting us. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain email correspondence from us which is not for marketing purposes, such as messages relating to your account or when we are required to email you about system updates or issues.<br>
    Please note, that to opt out of receiving mobile push notifications from Healthy LifeStyle, you can use your mobile device’s settings functionality to turn them off.
    Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. <br>
    You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
    <br>
    We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <h2>14. Children
  </h2>
  <p>Healthy LifeStyle site and/or mobile application is not intended for use by children under 16 years old. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us.

  <h2>15. Updates to This Privacy Policy
  </h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. We will obtain your consent to any material Privacy Policy changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws.</p>
